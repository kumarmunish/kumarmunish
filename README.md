### Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Site Reliability Engineer with a background in QA and a deep interest in how systems behave - especially in production. I care about building systems that are observable, scalable, and resilient. I began my journey as a QA engineer, working closely with backend teams to ensure stability and quality across rapid release cycles. Over time, I became fascinated with how systems break, recover, and scale - which naturally led me into SRE.

Today, With over 8 years of experience spanning QA, DevOps, and SRE, I specialize in helping teams ship reliably, recover quickly, and operate production systems with confidence. My work focuses on building internal tools, defining SLOs, implementing CI/CD pipelines, enhancing observability, and optimizing infrastructure to reduce noise and boost velocity. I'm driven by the goal of improving production visibility and creating a calmer on-call experience. I thrive in high-trust, blameless environments and enjoy mentoring junior engineers - especially those transitioning into SRE or DevOps, a journey I've taken myself.
